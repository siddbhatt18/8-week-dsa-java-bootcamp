## 💡 **Key Success Tips**

1. **Don't just code** - Understand WHY each approach works
2. **Time yourself** - Start with unlimited time, gradually add constraints
3. **Review others' solutions** - Learn multiple approaches
4. **Track patterns** - Keep a problem pattern journal
5. **Revisit problems** - Solve again after 2-3 weeks without looking at solution

## 📊 **Progress Tracking**

Create a spreadsheet with:
- Problem name/number
- Date attempted
- Time taken
- Solved independently? (Yes/No/Partial)
- Key concepts used
- Notes for review

## 🎯 **Expected Outcomes**

By the end of 8 weeks, you should be able to:
- Solve most Easy problems in 15-20 minutes
- Solve many Medium problems in 30-45 minutes
- Recognize common patterns instantly
- Optimize solutions for time/space complexity
- Confidently approach new problems with a structured methodology

Remember: **Quality > Quantity**. Understanding 100 problems deeply is better than rushing through 500 superficially.
