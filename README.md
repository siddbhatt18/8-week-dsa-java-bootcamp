## **Study Guidelines**

### Daily Routine (2-3 hours)
1. **Theory (30-45 min):** Read concept, watch 1 video
2. **Practice (60-90 min):** Solve assigned problems
3. **Review (30 min):** Document patterns, review solutions

### Problem-Solving Approach
1. **Understand (5 min):** Read twice, identify inputs/outputs
2. **Plan (10 min):** Brute force → Optimize → Pseudocode
3. **Code (20 min):** Implement solution
4. **Test (5 min):** Edge cases, dry run
5. **Review (10 min):** Compare with optimal solution

### When Stuck (20-Minute Rule)
- Struggle for 20 minutes independently
- Read hints/approach (not code)
- Try again for 15 minutes
- Study solution, then implement from memory next day

### Tracking Progress
Create a spreadsheet:
- Problem name & difficulty
- Time taken
- Initial attempt (Solved/Stuck/Gave up)
- Key learning
- Revisit date (3 days, 1 week, 1 month)
